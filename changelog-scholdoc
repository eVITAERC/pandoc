# Scholdoc change log
All notable changes to Scholdoc will be documented in this file.

This log pertains to Scholdoc development *only*. Pandoc changes remain in the `changelog` file.

Scholdoc follows semantic versioning with regards to output schema.

## In development

### Added
- Allow rudimentry Docx output, although most Scholmd elements map to empty

### Changed
- The program name is changed from `scholpandoc` to `scholdoc` to more accurately reflect the limited input/output options compared to Pandoc.

#### HTML output
- Uses HTTPS instead of protocol-relative URLs for default polyfills in the template from CDNJS. This will make previewing local HTML files much easier.

#### LaTeX output
- Added `indentparagraphs` variable to template, so you can change between "no indent/line-heigt paragraph margins" and "indent/no paragraph margins"

## 0.1.1-alpha - 2014-05-30

### Added
- Allow output of JSON-style native format

### Changed

#### LaTeX output
- No longer hard-codes the `htbp` placement of floats. This is now controlled in the template using the `Float` package.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where figures/floats display captions prefixes when it is not needed

## 0.1.0-alpha - 2014-04-22

### Changed

#### HTML output
- Conforms to ScholarlyMarkdown HTML5 Schema 0.1

### Fixed
- The `bibliography` metadata is now treated like a pure string and will not be formatted
- Display math and figure/floats now properly parses if delimiters have multiple trailing whitespaces
- Disabling standalone mode using `_bodyonly` suffix now works again
- Minor code cleanup using `hlint`, refactored various writer monads for floats

## 0.0.1-alpha - 2014-03-16

### Added
- Display math equations that uses the class `math_def` instead of `math` are now appended to a global variable called `$math-macros$`. In the updated templates this is placed in the header, and enables LaTeX declarations that only work in the header

### Changed
- ScholarlyPandoc now has the following arguments enabled by default: `-f markdown_scholarly --smart --parse-raw --standalone`. Renaming the executable to anything other than `scholpandoc` reverts this behavior

### Fixes
- Fixed a bug where templates files are not compiled into the binary, resulting in complaints about "can't find file ..."

## 0.0.0-alpha - 2014-03-14

Initial Release
